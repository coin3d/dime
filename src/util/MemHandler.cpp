  \class dimeMemHandler dime/util/MemHandler.h
  \brief The dimeMemHandler class is a special-purpose memory manager.

  Using this class will give you efficient memory allocation and extremely
  efficient deallocation.  In addition, there is almost \e no overhead on
  the memory allocated.  The drawback is that it is not possible to
  deallocate a block of memory once it is allocated; all the allocated memory
  must be deallocated in one operation.

  If you plan to use DIME in a way that requires lots of dynamic allocation
  / deallocation of for instance entities, you should not use the memory
  manager - the standard new / delete operators should be used instead.
  The most common use of dime is to import and export DXF files, so
  the data structure is just built and then freed up all at once.  For this
  kind of usage, the special-purpose memory manager is far superior to the
  system memory manager.
